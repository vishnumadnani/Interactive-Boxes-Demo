About This Demo
---------------

This demo showcases interactive product selection boxes designed to simulate a "Buy One Get One" (BOGO) offer. 
The purpose of this task is to assess your front-end development skills, including your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as your attention to detail, code structuring, and problem-solving abilities.

Key Features:
--------------
Selectable Product Units: Users can choose between 1, 2, or 3 units, each with its own pricing and discount badge.

Expandable Details: Each box contains additional options (size and color) that expand smoothly when a box is selected.

Dynamic Pricing: The total price updates automatically based on the selected unit using JavaScript.

Custom Radio Buttons: Styled radio buttons indicate the selected option with smooth animations.

Accessibility Features: aria-expanded and aria-hidden attributes are used to improve accessibility.

Responsive Design: Works well on mobile and desktop screens.

Technical Highlights:

HTML Structure: Semantic and organized with proper use of <label>, <input>, and <select> elements.

CSS Styling: Modern styles with variables, custom radio buttons, hover/active states, and smooth transitions.

JavaScript Logic:

Handles collapse and expand of boxes dynamically.

Updates total price based on the selected unit.

Ensures only one box is active at a time.

Learning Goals Demonstrated:

Structuring interactive UI components.

Using CSS variables and transitions for a modern interface.

Manipulating DOM elements and attributes dynamically with JavaScript.

Handling user events and accessibility attributes effectively.

Writing clean, maintainable, and reusable code.

This demo represents a hands-on approach to solving a real front-end task, showing attention to detail and a commitment to creating user-friendly interactive components.
